   <h4>SmartDrop Support Policy</h4> <br> <br>
    <p>Welcome to SmartDrop Mall.  SmartDrop Mall is an additional service on SmartDrop where SmartDrop-registered Buyers will be able to enjoy the rights and privileges described in these SmartDrop Support Policys (these “SmartDrop Support Policy”) when purchasing Mall Items (defined below) on SmartDrop Mall from any of our participating Sellers that have been carefully selected by SmartDrop (such Sellers, “Mall Sellers”, and such Buyers, “Mall Buyers”). If you are a Mall Buyer, you will be deemed to have consented to the terms and conditions described in these SmartDrop Support Policy when you make purchases on SmartDrop Mall.  Similarly, if you are a Mall Seller, you will be deemed to have consented to the terms and conditions described in these SmartDrop Support Policy by your continued participation in SmartDrop Mall.  These SmartDrop Support Policy supplement the Terms of Service and the other SmartDrop Policies, of which these SmartDrop Support Policy forms a part – please read the Terms of Szervice and the other SmartDrop Policies available on the Site as they contain important information regarding your rights and obligations.  Any terms that are used in these SmartDrop Support Policy that are not defined here will have the meanings given to such terms in the Terms of Service and/or the applicable SmartDrop Policy.  All terms and conditions described in these SmartDrop Support Policy are subject to change at SmartDrop’s discretion pursuant to the Terms of Service.  </p>
    <p>1. SmartDrop Mall Refunds and Return Policy</p>
    <p>Mall Buyer may apply for a refund and/or return of an item purchased on SmartDrop Mall (a “Mall Item”) by completing a return/refund request and returning the Mall Item as described below at any time within fifteen (15) calendar days after the date that Mall Item was first made available for Mall Buyer to take delivery (the “Free Return Period”). Usually, that date would be the date Mall Buyer received delivery of the Mall Item; however, if Mall Buyer did not receive the Mall Item because of Mall Buyer’s absence from the destination address or Mall Buyer’s failure to input the proper destination address, that date would be the date on which delivery attempt was first made.</p>
    <p> Please note that Mall Buyer must ship the Mall Item to a location designated by SmartDrop within ten (10) calendar days after the return request is raised and in any event no later than the last day of the Free Return Period.  Mall Items that are returned may be returned via Singpost, PopStation or a courier designated by SmartDrop by no later than the last day of the Free Return Period.  SmartDrop reserves the right to reject any application where the Mall Item was dispatched later than ten (10) calendar days after the return request is raised.</p>
    <p>The approval of your request for refund and return will be made by SmartDrop in its sole discretion after reviewing your completed refund/return request and inspecting the condition of the Mall Item that was returned. Mall Buyer acknowledges and agrees that SmartDrop’s decision is final, conclusive and binding, and covenants and agrees that it will not bring suit or otherwise assert any claim against SmartDrop or its affiliates in relation to such decision.  The Mall Item that was returned must be, at a minimum, in the following conditions: </p> <br>
        <ul>
            <li>New and sealed condition;</li>
            <li>Complete, with all items included in the purchase; and</li> 
            <li>With original product packaging and price tags.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>If any additional conditions apply to a certain Mall Item, SmartDrop will inform you via the Site, SMS or email.  The conditions for the Mall Items subject to return are referred to as the “Return Conditions”.</p>
    <p>In addition, please note that certain types of Mall Items may be excluded from the Refunds and Return Policy described in these SmartDrop Support Policy, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul> Electronics;
            <li>Digital goods, such as mobile top-up cards, audio or video recording or software;</li>
            <li> Goods that are perishable or may otherwise deteriorate or expire rapidly, such as groceries; and</li>
            <li> Goods that are perishable or may otherwise deteriorate or expire rapidly, such as groceries; and</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If any Mall Item is excluded from the Refunds and Return Policy described in these SmartDrop Support Policy, SmartDrop will make reasonable efforts to publish that information on our Site or otherwise inform the Mall Buyers; however, please note that our policies may change without notice at any time and certain Mall Items may be subject to exclusion after Mall Buyer has purchased them.  Any Mall Item that is subject to exclusion from the Refunds and Return Policy described in these SmartDrop Support Policy is referred to as an “Excluded Item”. </p>
        <p>SmartDrop reserves the right to (a) add to or otherwise amend the list of Excluded Items and/or the Return Conditions and (b) amend, terminate or suspend the Refunds and Return Policy described in these SmartDrop Support Policy (including the length of the Free Return Period), in each case, at any time in its sole discretion. </p>
        <p>eapurchase may reject in its sole discretion any returned Mall Item (and the related request for refund and return):</p>
        <ul>
            <li> that is an Excluded Item;</li>
            <li>that does not meet the Return Conditions; or</li>
            <li>if the Mall Item was returned in a manner that does not comply with Section 1.2 above.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note that SmartDrop’s determination will be based on the list of terms of conditions in effect at the time of such determination (including the list of Excluded Items, the Return Conditions and the Free Return Period), and therefore pursuant to Section 1.5 above, such list of Excluded Items, the Return Conditions and/or the length of Free Return Period may be different from those in effect at the time Mall Buyer has completed the refund/return request and/or returned the Mall Item.

 <br><br>

            If SmartDrop rejects a request for refund and return, SmartDrop will organize the delivery of such Mall Item to the relevant Mall Buyer’s address to which the Mall Item was originally delivered, and SmartDrop shall be entitled to seek compensation from such Mall Buyer for any costs incurred in delivering the Mall Item back to such Mall Buyer.</p>
        <p>SmartDrop reserves the right to terminate a User’s access to SmartDrop Mall if it suspects any abuse of the Refunds and Return Policy described in these SmartDrop Support Policy and, if SmartDrop deems appropriate, may also impose penalties (including recovery of any fees or charges incurred as a consequence of such abuse).

 <br><br>

       he Refunds and Return Policy for Mall Items described in these SmartDrop Support Policy are in addition to the general Refunds and Return Policy described in the Refunds and Return Policy.  If there is any inconsistency, the Refunds and Return Policy described in these SmartDrop Support Policy will prevail in respect of Mall Items.</p>
    <p>2. Mall Seller Terms and Conditions</p>
    <p>If you are a Mall Seller, you should have received a separate written notification from SmartDrop informing you of your selection to participate in SmartDrop Mall.  If you decide not to participate in SmartDrop Mall at any time, please inform SmartDrop in writing; otherwise, you will be deemed to have elected to continue your participation in SmartDrop Mall and consented to the terms and conditions set out in these SmartDrop Support Policy. SmartDrop may, at any time and at its sole discretion, suspend or remove any Mall Seller from the SmartDrop Mall program.   

 
<br><br>
    Each Mall Seller warrants that the Mall Item it offers on SmartDrop Mall and actually delivered to Mall Buyer (a) complies with (i) applicable law and (ii) the specifications listed (and made available to Mall Buyer) on the Site, including any and all product warranties, specifications, drawings, samples, performance criteria and all applicable quality, safety and hygiene requirements, and (b) will be free from defects.  Each Mall Seller understands and agrees that it will be responsible for any non-conformity or defect in, or any public or private recall of, any of the Mall Items, and will hold SmartDrop harmless from any losses relating to the foregoing.
     <br><br>   
     If a Mall Seller is found to have offered or sold any Mall Item on SmartDrop Mall that is restricted under SmartDrop’s Prohibited and Restricted Items Policy,  SmartDrop reserves the right to, at its sole discretion, remove the offending Mall Items from SmartDrop Mall, and execute refunds (and any adjustments) to Mall Buyers who have purchased such Mall Items (even if Mall Buyers did not comply with any of the requirements described in Section 1 above), in which case Mall Seller agrees to reimburse SmartDrop for all such refunds (including any related costs and charges) and authorizes SmartDrop to deduct such amounts from any amounts payable to Mall Seller or take such other action as deemed appropriate by SmartDrop in its discretion.
        
         
    <br><br>    
    SmartDrop’s determination to approve a refund or return of a Mall Item pursuant to Section 1 above is binding on the relevant Mall Seller.  Mall Sellers agree to comply and do all such things as necessary to give effect to a Mall Buyer’s request for a refund or return approved by SmartDrop.
        
         
    <br><br>    
    For any refund or return request approved by SmartDrop, SmartDrop will organize the delivery of the relevant returned Mall Item to the address provided by the relevant Mall Seller to SmartDrop in writing for the completion of the refund and return process, at no additional cost to such Mall Seller so long as such address is in the country in which the relevant Mall Item was listed for sale on the Site (a “Local Address”).  If Mall Seller fails to provide a Local Address for return of the returned Mall Item or otherwise fails to accept delivery of the returned Mall Item within a reasonable period of time (as determined by SmartDrop), SmartDrop reserves the right to dispose of such Mall Item in any manner it sees fit and Mall Seller shall be deemed to have forfeited all rights to such Mall Item. Mall Seller must notify SmartDrop within seven (7) days of receiving the Email Notification (“Notification Period”) if Mall Seller does not receive the returned Mall Item.  Failure to notify SmartDrop within the Notification Period shall be conclusive evidence of, and result in the Mall Seller having accepted that, the delivery of the Mall Item has occurred, and Mall Seller agrees not to make any claims or raise any disputes regarding any such Mall Item.
        
         
    <br><br>    
    Notwithstanding the above, SmartDrop may determine at its sole and absolute discretion that a Mall Item approved for refund or return shall not be returned to Mall Seller, and Mall Seller shall be deemed to have forfeited all rights to such Mall Item.  
        
         
    <br><br>    
    For any refund or return rejected by SmartDrop where the relevant Mall Item was received by SmartDrop, SmartDrop will organize the delivery of such Mall Item to the relevant Mall Buyer’s address pursuant to Section 1.6 above.    
        
         <br><br>
        
    Where SmartDrop approves any refund or return request, Mall Seller may appeal such decision by contacting SmartDrop and providing evidence in support of such appeal.  If SmartDrop upholds Mall Seller’s appeal, it will disburse all or part of the Buyer’s Purchase Monies to Mall Seller.  Mall Seller acknowledges and agrees that SmartDrop’s decision is final, conclusive and binding, and covenants and agrees that it will not bring suit or otherwise assert any claim against SmartDrop or its affiliates in relation to such decision.</p>
    <p>3. SmartDrop Mall 100% Authentic Product Policy</p>
    <p> All products listed by Mall Sellers must be 100% authentic. 
        <br><br>
    Counterfeit products are prohibited from being listed in SmartDrop Mall.  The term “counterfeit” encompasses a product that was made in exact imitation of an existing brand with the intention to deceive or defraud and may include, but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A product that violates any local country laws in which they are sold;</li>
        <li>A product that is a fake or a replica of an existing official product;</li>
        <li>A product that has never been produced by a specific brand;</li>
        <li>A product that is significantly under-priced;</li>
        <li>A product containing a registered trademark on the product, the packaging or anywhere related to the product without the authorization of the trademark owner;</li>
        <li>A product that contains specific design elements (e.g. cartoon characters or colourways) protected by a trademark; without the authorization of the trademark owner;</li>
        <li> A product that bears such similarities with other products (e.g. a replica of a branded item with or without altered logos) without the authorization of the trademark owner;</li>
        <li>A product that has no visible trademark on the product image on the listing, but the delivered product includes a trademark; and</li>
        <li> Usage of a photo on the listing that contains the trademark of a brand.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) brands are permitted as long as no official brand logo is displayed on any OEM product image and no official brand name is stated in any part of the product information.
        <br><br>

If requested by SmartDrop, the Mall Seller shall promptly provide documentation to SmartDrop that proves (to SmartDrop’s reasonable satisfaction) the authenticity of the Mall Item including, but not limited to, manufacturer sales invoices, authorized distribution agreements and/or certificates of authenticity (“Proof of Authenticity”).</p>
    <p>If the Mall Seller fails to provide Proof of Authenticity, the Mall Seller shall:

 <br>

        (a)     accept the return of the Mall Item from the Mall Buyer;
        
         
        <br>
        (b)     refund to the Mall Buyer twice the amount that the Mall Buyer paid for the Mall Item or, where SmartDrop has already refunded this amount to the Mall Buyer, the Mall Seller shall refund such amount to SmartDrop;
        
         <br>
        
        (c)     be liable to compensate SmartDrop for such other costs, expenses, losses and liabilities suffered or incurred by SmartDrop (including, but not limited to, loss of goodwill) as determined at SmartDrop’s sole discretion.</p>
        <p> In the event that SmartDrop determines, at its sole discretion, that Mall Seller has violated Section 3, SmartDrop may take all appropriate measures, including but not limited to removing the counterfeit Mall Item listing from the Site, prohibiting the publication of the same or similar goods and/or restricting, suspending or terminating the Mall Seller's SmartDrop account and/or access to SmartDrop Mall.  Mall Seller's obligations and liabilities under these Terms of Service will not be affected by the restriction, suspension or termination of the Mall Seller’s account.</p>
